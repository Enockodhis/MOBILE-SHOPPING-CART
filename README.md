# MOBILE-SHOPPING-CART
A mobile shopping cart refers to the feature within a mobile application or a mobile-friendly website that allows users to browse, select, and store items they wish to purchase.

5. Personalization: May offer personalized recommendations based on the user's browsing history and preferences.

6. Notifications: Can send notifications about price drops, special offers, or reminders about items left in the cart.

7. Integration with Other Features: Often integrated with other mobile app features such as wish lists, user reviews, and detailed product descriptions.
